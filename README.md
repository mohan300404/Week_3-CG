- Use cases of LinkedList in real-world problems

### Day 2: Stack, Queue, HashMap, Hashing
- Stack:
  - LIFO structure using arrays or LinkedList
- Queue:
  - FIFO logic with Java Queue interface
- HashMap:

  - Common methods (`put`, `get`, `containsKey`)
- Introduction to Hashing and Hash Functions

### Day 3: Sorting Algorithms
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Time complexity of each algorithm
- Practical usage and limitations

### Day 4 & 5: Searching and File Handling
- Linear Search and Binary Search algorithms
- Java I/O Classes:
  - `StringBuilder` vs `StringBuffer`
  - Reading input using `BufferedReader`, `FileReader`, and `InputStreamReader`
- Hands-on file input/output examples

### Day 6: Algorithm Runtime Analysis
